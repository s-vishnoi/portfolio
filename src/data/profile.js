  description: `I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at Northwestern University passionate about using large-scale data to uncover social inequalities.

My work at Northwestern bridges the gaps in Arrest data collection across the United States, building end-to-end data pipelines that convert scattered, missing, or incomplete data reports into a comprehensive dataset for informed policy-making.

Currently, I jointly work as a Data Scientist at the Max Planck Institute where we are tasked with building a demographic dataset on researchers globally, identifying key inequalities in publication patterns and migration networks.

I'm always looking for meaningful problems, good collaborators, and the next system worth exploring.`,
