    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">Gobal Research Equality</h1>
    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively from isolated lenses
      i.e. seniority, productivity, mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage 45M+ publication records to extract the career trajectories of 30M+ researchers (anonymized) across ~200 countries.
      We define and measure population growth, migration networks, and demographic parity- providing a novel global outlook for policy.

          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
            Representation in science is usually studied through narrow slices—one country, one discipline, one career stage. That fragmentation leaves global ministries guessing about where the pipeline breaks down.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
            We needed a single narrative that connects who enters, who migrates, and who stalls so policy makers can argue from evidence instead of anecdotes.

          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
            Our team linked 45M+ publication records to 30M anonymized researchers, reconstructed their institutional moves, and harmonized gender and discipline labels across ~200 countries.

            The pipeline produces migration graphs, prestige flow indices, and demographic parity scores that update as soon as new bibliometric feeds arrive.

          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
            We uncovered stalled gains for women in several fast-growing disciplines, identified choke points where prestige and funding concentrate, and mapped brain circulation loops among the Global South.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
            These findings show that equality plateaus long before PhD graduation—and that mobility subsidies alone cannot fix the imbalance.

            The resulting baselines are now guiding multilateral funders as they design mobility grants, and several ministries are using our parity indices to set 2030 representation targets.
