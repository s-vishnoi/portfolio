    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">Gobal Research Equality</h1>
    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively from isolated lenses
      i.e. seniority, productivity, mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage 45M+ publication records to extract the career trajectories of 30M+ researchers (anonymized) across ~200 countries.
      We define and measure population growth, migration networks, and demographic parity- providing a novel global outlook for policy.

        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Problem —</span>
        Representation in science is usually told as isolated vignettes—one country’s tenure stats here, one grant program there—so ministries debate gender equality with anecdotes while the global pipeline quietly leaks talent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Method —</span>
        We stitched together 45M+ publication records, harmonized author identities for 30M anonymized researchers, and reconstructed mobility paths across ~200 countries, normalizing discipline labels, inferring institutional prestige, and generating time-aware parity indices that update with each bibliometric release.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Findings —</span>
        The resulting narrative is nuanced: gains for women plateau in the disciplines that attract the most funding, migration networks create chokepoints where prestige consolidates, and brain circulation within the Global South looks more reciprocal than the northbound flows policymakers usually cite.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Impact —</span>
        Equipped with these baselines, multilateral funders are redesigning mobility grants and several ministries are piloting 2030 parity targets grounded in our indices; once the Science manuscript clears review, the cleaned datasets and code will ship publicly so others can audit, challenge, and extend the story.
