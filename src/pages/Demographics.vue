    <p>
      I developed a dataset covering 95M+ papers and 33M researchers to analyze how academic opportunities are
      distributed around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tracked publication trends, migration networks, and long-term productivity by country, gender, and institution.
      This lets universities and policymakers see where systemic bias or imbalance exists â€” and how it changes over time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> First-of-its-kind dataset revealing invisible inequalities in global science careers. Supports more equitable research systems.</p>
