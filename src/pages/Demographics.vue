    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">Gobal Research Equality</h1>
    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively from isolated lenses
      i.e. seniority, productivity, mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage 45M+ publication records to extract the career trajectories of 30M+ researchers (anonymized) across ~200 countries.
      We define and measure population growth, migration networks, and demographic parity- providing a novel global outlook for policy.

        <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
          Representation in science is usually told as isolated vignettes—one country’s tenure stats here, one grant program there. That patchwork leaves ministries debating gender equality with anecdotes while the global pipeline leaks talent quietly.

          We stitched together 45M+ publication records, harmonized author identities for 30M anonymized researchers, and reconstructed mobility paths across ~200 countries. Along the way we normalized discipline labels, inferred institutional prestige, and generated time-aware parity indices that update as new bibliometric feeds arrive.

          The narrative that emerges is nuanced: gains for women plateau in the very disciplines attracting the most funding; migration networks create chokepoints where prestige consolidates; and brain circulation within the Global South looks different—and more reciprocal—than the northbound flows policymakers typically cite.

          Armed with these baselines, multilateral funders are redesigning mobility grants, and several ministries are testing 2030 parity targets grounded in our indices rather than gut instinct. Once the Science manuscript clears review, the cleaned datasets and code will ship publicly so other teams can audit, challenge, and extend the story.
