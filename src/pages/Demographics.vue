    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">Gobal Research Equality</h1>
    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively from isolated lenses
      i.e. seniority, productivity, mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage 45M+ publication records to extract the career trajectories of 30M+ researchers (anonymized) across ~200 countries.
      We define and measure population growth, migration networks, and demographic parity- providing a novel global outlook for policy.

        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Problem —</span>
        Discussions about equity in science are usually staged through narrow lenses—one country’s tenure stats here, one grant program there—so policy makers chase symptoms instead of understanding the global pipeline that leaks talent at every transition.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Method —</span>
        Our team linked more than forty-five million publication records, harmonized identities for thirty million anonymized researchers, and reconstructed their career arcs across roughly two hundred countries, including inferred discipline tags, prestige flows, and mobility edges that refresh as soon as new bibliometric feeds arrive.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Findings —</span>
        The story that emerges is layered: women’s representation has stalled precisely in the disciplines that are expanding fastest, migration networks form choke points that trap prestige within a handful of nations, and South-to-South collaborations behave nothing like the northbound pipelines typically used to justify funding models.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-charcoal leading-relaxed">
        <span class="font-semibold text-ink uppercase tracking-[1px]">Impact —</span>
        With those baselines in hand, multilateral funders are redesigning mobility grants, ministries are piloting 2030 parity targets rooted in our parity indices, and—as soon as the Science manuscript passes review—the cleaned datasets plus reproducible code will ship publicly so anyone can extend or challenge the narrative.
