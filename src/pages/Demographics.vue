    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively in individual aspects of the acadmeic career
      pipeline i.e. joining academia, dropping out, location, and mobility etc. there has been a lack of large scale 
      ground truth data in informing our progress towards academic equality. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage publication records from SCOPUS on 95M+ papers to create a novel global dataset on researchers and 
      analyze how academic opportunities are distributed around the world.
      We track publication trends, migration networks, and long-term productivity by country, gender, and institution.
      This lets universities and policymakers see where systemic bias or imbalance exists â€” and how it has changed over time.
