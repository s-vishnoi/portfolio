    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-4">Gobal Research Equality</h1>
    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively from isolated lenses
      i.e. seniority, productivity, mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage 45M+ research records to extract the career trajectories of 30M+ researchers (anonymized) across ~200 countries.
      We define and measure country-level academic growth, migration networks, and demographic equality- providing a novel global outlook for policy.
