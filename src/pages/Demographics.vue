    <p>
      While representation in academia has been studied extensively in individual aspects
      i.e. joining, dropping out, location, and mobility etc., comprehensive  
      ground truth data informing global equality remains missing.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We leverage records of 95M+ research papers to create a novel dataset on researchers in 180 countries.
      We introduce methods to measure and track academic growth, migration networks, and demographic inequalities, 
      informing key decision metrics for universities and policy makers.
