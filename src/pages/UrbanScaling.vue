    <p>
      Most cities grow, but they don't grow evenly. Larger cities often have disproportionate increases in crime,
      income, and innovation. I studied these dynamics using scaling laws â€” mathematical relationships that describe
      how various urban indicators grow with population size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using FBI and Census data across hundreds of U.S. cities, I modeled how crime rates, infrastructure needs,
      and economic output scale with city size. I applied Bayesian and regression techniques to account for reporting
      gaps and uncertainty in the data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Offers a framework to compare cities fairly, identify outliers, and inform urban planning decisions that account for nonlinear growth patterns.</p>
