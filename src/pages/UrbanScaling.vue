    <p>
      Most cities grow, but they don't grow evenly. Larger cities often have disproportionate increases in crime,
      income, and innovation. I studied these dynamics using scaling laws â€” mathematical relationships that describe
      how various urban indicators grow with population size.

    <p>
      Using FBI and Census data across hundreds of U.S. cities, I modeled how crime rates, demographic indicators,
      and economic distributions scale with city size. I applied Bayesian and regression techniques to robustly account for wide reporting
      gaps and uncertainty in the data.
