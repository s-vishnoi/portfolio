    <p>
      Most cities grow, but they don't grow evenly. Larger cities often have disproportionate increases in crime,
      income, and innovation. I study the dynamics of scaling laws â€” mathematical relationships that describe
      how various urban indicators grow with population size. These relationships have enormous potential in not 
      only filling the gaps in our understanding of the present but also preparing us for future resource needs.

      Arrest data collected from law agencies acorss the U.S. is heavily missing due to a voluntary reporting program. 
      A major challenge remains identfying missing and underreported values.

      I leverage scaling laws to inform corrected rates as well as uncertainty estimates for 300 U.S. cities. 
      I utilize multi-level Bayesian estimations for including time and regional variations while maintainting transparency in model certainty.
